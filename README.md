# Survival-Analysis
This is the project report for course *Statistical Analysis of Reliability and Survival Data*.

## Introduction
Survival analysis which studies the time until an event of interest takes place is widely used in the fields of medicine, agriculture, sociology and engineering. In this report, we will apply the methods and software we learned in the course to analyze the dataset we selected. In part A, we will do a descriptive analysis of the variables in the dataset and mainly consider the variable which is censored. In part B, we will focus on the response variable and categorical variable. In part C, we will consider all variables in the dataset by using the COX model and parametric regression model. Through the research, we can have a better understanding of the course.
